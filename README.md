# Probabilities and Statistics Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a university project focused on probabilities and statistics. The project aims to develop various functions and utilities for analyzing random variables and their joint distributions.

## **Functionalities provided for Discrete Random Variables:**
- **Generating Joint Distributions:** Implement functions to generate incomplete joint distributions for discrete random variables X and Y, allowing for later completion.
- **Completing Joint Distributions:** Develop functions to complete the generated joint distributions, considering both specific and general cases.
- **Marginal Distributions:** Construct functions to derive marginal distributions for X and Y from their joint distribution.
- **Covariance Calculation:** Create a function to calculate the covariance for given random variables Z = aX + bY and T = cX + dY.
- **Conditional Probability:** Implement a function to calculate conditional probability for random variables X and Y from their joint distribution.
- **Joint Probability:** Develop a function to calculate probabilities related to the pair (X, Y) from their joint distribution.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilize the generated joint distribution to compute various statistical measures and probabilities, including covariance and conditional probabilities.
- **Independence and Correlation:** Design functions to verify whether random variables X and Y are independent or uncorrelated.
- **Visual Representation:** Propose visual representations for joint distributions of random variables X, Y, and Z, along with interpretations of marginal distributions in the case of a tridimensional variable.

## **Functionalities provided for Continuous Random Variables:**
- **Fubini's Theorem Verification:** Verify the applicability of Fubini's Theorem for computing double integrals of user-defined functions.
- **Geometric Interpretation:** Provide a geometric interpretation of double integrals.
- **Density Function Verification:** Check if a user-defined function with two variables is a probability density function.
- **Continuous Random Variables:** Create continuous random variables based on user-provided probability density functions, supporting both unidimensional and bidimensional variables.
